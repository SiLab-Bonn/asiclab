Optiplex 3060 has same behavior, on HDMI and display port!!
AlmaLinux has same behavior, even installed from scatch:
With no GPU installed
With Workstation only, still happens


What about different OSes? Rocky or Fedora, or Ubuntu?
Is is perhaps the BIOS settings?
Does it happen with just the headless display? With no workstation install?
